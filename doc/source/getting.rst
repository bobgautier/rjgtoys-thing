Getting it
==========

By the time you read this, ``rjgtoys-thing`` should be available on PyPi::

    pip install --user rjgtoys-thing

To get the source code::

    git clone https://github.com/bobgautier/rjgtoys-Thing.git

To make the package available for your Python::

    cd rjgtoys-Thing
    python ./setup.py develop --user

If you are using a virtualenv, you should omit the ``--user`` option used
in these examples.
